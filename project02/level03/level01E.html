<p>Fireflies &nbspin &nbspthe &nbspGarden</p>
<p>Robert Frost 1928</p>
<br>
<p>Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<p>And here on earth come emulating flies,</p>
<br>
<p>That &nbspthough &nbsp&nbspthey &nbspnever equal &nbsp&nbspstars in &nbsp&nbsp&nbspsize,</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(And they were never really stars at heart)</p>
<br>
<p>Achieve at times a very star-like start.</p>
<br>
<p>Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.</p>
