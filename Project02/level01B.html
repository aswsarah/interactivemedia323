<p>Fireflies in the Garden</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,</p>
<p>And here on earth come emulating flies,</p>
<p>That though they never equal stars in size,</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(And they were never really stars at heart)</p>
<br>
<p>Achieve at times a very star-like start.</p>
<p>Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.</p>
<br>
